# SceneAssets

#### Assets for your Unity scene

## VRC Mirror
This package has a VRC Mirror, which functions the same way as in the World SDK<br>
You can check how your avatar looks in the mirror, in case you have mirror specific shader options going on

## Post Processing Camera
This camera has post processing (and Anti-aliasing) set up<br><br>
<b>Note: You still have to install the Post Processing package from the Unity Package Manager</b>
<br>

## How to use
You can spawn these assets from the ``TohruTheDragon/Scene Assets`` menu<br>
If you have something selected in your scene, then as the asset spawns, it will be 1 meter ahead of it, facing it<br>
<br>
<b>Make sure to delete or disable your own camera in your scene, if you want to use the ``Post Processing Camera``!</b>
You can modify the post processing settings on the ``Post Processing`` object, which is the child of the ``Post Processing Camera``
